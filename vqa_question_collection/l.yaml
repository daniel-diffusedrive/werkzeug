- prompt: "An eo image from a uav. The image captures a serene view of the open ocean under a vast, overcast sky, where the horizon stretches endlessly into the distance. The sea appears calm with gentle ripples reflecting the diffused sunlight, creating a shimmering effect across the water's surface. Thirty ships are arranged in a horizontal line across the expanse, their silhouettes clearly visible against the vastness of the sea. The perspective seems to be from a high vantage point, possibly from an aerial drone, offering a broad, level view that emphasizes the boundless nature of the ocean. The sky is filled with a mix of thin, wispy clouds and denser, darker formations, suggesting a cloudy day without strong precipitation. There are no visible signs of strong wind or rough seas, as the water remains relatively tranquil. The overall scene evokes a sense of solitude and tranquility, with the formation of vessels adding a striking human presence to this vast maritime landscape."
